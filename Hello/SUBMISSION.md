# Warmup

The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I test on Nexus 6p with Marshmallow for device and Nexus 5 with Lollipop 5.0 for emulator. I targeted Lollipop 5.0.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> 3-4 hours total, mostly trying to figure out how the setup and what not worked.


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I did talk with Sean Ker and Jeff Zhong, but not too much. I would ask a question and I would have it figured out by the time they replied. Also had to google a few things few things about Java, mostlyh looking at the API.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think Step 2 could have been clarified a little better that "gradle build" would only work properly after Step 3. I did run into some trouble setting up the emulator where it would not start without showing any pop up errors. Solved by basically installing everything in the SDK manager.
