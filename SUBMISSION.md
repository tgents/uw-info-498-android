The below questions should be answered regarding your submission!

##### For a first real assignment: too big, too small, just right? #####
> I think it was just slightly too big, there were a lot of concepts that I had not fully grasped. I was kind of just throwing stuff at the app to see if it would work at certain points.


##### What model device did you test your application on? What SDK did you target? #####
> I used it on a Nexu 6P with API 23 Anrdoid 6.0, but the application was targeted for API 21 Android 5.0


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Around 7 hours start to finish, with a few breaks in between. 


##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> Sean Ker, mostly for clarification when we were stuck. Used google and stack overflow for some api consulting and quality of life changes, like hiding the keyboard.


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> I think it was hard understanding some of the things we were doing, especially the interaction between XML and Java. It kind of felt like I was just trusting that the stuff we learned in class would work out (which it did.)
